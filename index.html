    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp My name is Josh Strother and I made this site! 
        &nbspI have a B.S.  in Computer Science & I graduated from ECU in December of 2023.
        I am from Coalgate Oklahoma.  I have one son whose name is Winston (pictured above in my arms).  
        &nbsp I am happily engaged to my beautiful fiance Bailye.  
        </p>
    <br>
    <h3>What is My Experience?</h3>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Currently, I only have academic experience.  &nbspThis site is one of the projects 
            I have worked on. I have done school work in Python, HTML, CSS, PHP, C, C++, SQL, and even some Bash and Perl!
        </p>
    <br>
    <h3>What Makes Me a Good Fit?</h3>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Regardless of my experience, I am open to learning. &nbsp I will do whatever it takes
            to be more than proficient at my job. &nbsp I plan to be one of the best no matter my position.
            &nbsp I strive to be recognized for my ambition. 
        </p>
    <br>
    <h3>What is My Goal in Life?</h3>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy long-term goal is to be financially stable and be able to make awesome memories with my family.
            &nbspA short-term goal of mine is to get more work experience.  
            A dream of mine is to own a home.  I want to be able to provide my family with whatever it is they may need 
            and allow my son to have the life he deserves.
